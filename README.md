# open-ventilator

Please see Johnny Lee’s ventilator project (the video gives a great overview): https://github.com/jcl5m1/ventilator).
It's a working starting point. 

This Google doc (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KpPWYRb1A637Cp5KIhhKtuGFS8Cdm5fGra3TTwwrBKo/edit#) is a proposal for progressive further development of the design, component by component. The goal is to create a more flexible and robust device that could be suitable for production in quantity.

There's also some useful resources and information that I have collected from the last couple of days of discussion on helpfulengineering.slack.com , and elsewhere.

Discussion of this proposal has taken place on https://join.slack.com/t/open-ventilator/shared_invite/zt-cwh6py1x-C5tO4JewMUf2tRN7rwWB~g
